# OpenTelemetry on AWS EKS: Architecture Design

## 1. Introduction to OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides a standardized way to generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) from your applications. It is vendor-agnostic, meaning you can use it with various backend monitoring systems. The project is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) incubating project, formed by the merger of OpenTracing and OpenCensus.

### Key Concepts:

*   **Traces:** Represent the end-to-end journey of a request through a distributed system. A trace is composed of spans.
*   **Spans:** Individual units of work within a trace, representing operations like an HTTP request, a database query, or a function call. Spans have a name, a start time, an end time, attributes (key-value pairs), and can have child spans.
*   **Metrics:** Numerical measurements collected over time, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, request rates, or error counts. OpenTelemetry supports various metric types like counters, gauges, and histograms.
*   **Logs:** Timestamped records of events that occur within an application or system. OpenTelemetry aims to provide a unified approach to logging, linking logs to traces and spans for better context.
*   **Instrumentation:** The process of adding code to an application to generate telemetry data. OpenTelemetry provides APIs and SDKs for various programming languages to facilitate automatic and manual instrumentation.
*   **OpenTelemetry Collector:** A vendor-agnostic proxy that can receive, process, and export telemetry data. It can be deployed as an agent (sidecar or daemonset) on each host or as a gateway (standalone service) to collect data from multiple sources before sending it to one or more backends.
*   **Exporters:** Components that send telemetry data from the OpenTelemetry SDKs or Collector to various backend systems (e.g., Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, AWS X-Ray, CloudWatch).

## 2. AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Basics

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS. EKS handles the heavy lifting of running the Kubernetes control plane, allowing users to focus on deploying and managing their applications.

### Key Features:

*   **Managed Control Plane:** AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane (API server, etcd, scheduler, etc.), ensuring high availability and reliability.
*   **Worker Nodes:** Users provision and manage their worker nodes (EC2 instances) where application pods run. These can be managed node groups, self-managed nodes, or Fargate (serverless compute for containers).
*   **Integration with AWS Services:** EKS integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Amazon VPC for networking, IAM for authentication and authorization, Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution, and Amazon EBS for storage.
*   **Scalability and Reliability:** EKS provides the underlying infrastructure for scalable and reliable Kubernetes deployments.

## 3. OpenTelemetry on AWS EKS Architecture

Deploying OpenTelemetry on AWS EKS involves instrumenting applications, collecting telemetry data using the OpenTelemetry Collector, and exporting it to a chosen observability backend. For this demonstration, we will use a self-hosted observability stack including Jaeger for tracing, Prometheus for metrics, and Grafana for visualization.

### Proposed Architecture:

1.  **Application Instrumentation:**
    *   The sample microservices application (OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop) will be instrumented using OpenTelemetry SDKs in their respective programming languages. This will generate traces, metrics, and logs.
    *   Automatic instrumentation will be leveraged where possible, and manual instrumentation will be added for specific business logic or custom metrics.

2.  **OpenTelemetry Collector Deployment:**
    *   The OpenTelemetry Collector will be deployed as a DaemonSet or Sidecar within the EKS cluster. For simplicity and to minimize resource consumption in a free tier account, a DaemonSet deployment is often preferred for collecting host-level metrics and logs, while sidecars can be used for application-specific traces.
    *   The Collector will be configured to receive data from the instrumented applications (e.g., OTLP receiver).
    *   Processors will be used to batch, filter, or enrich the telemetry data.
    *   Exporters will be configured to send the processed data to Jaeger (for traces), Prometheus (for metrics), and potentially a logging solution (e.g., Loki or directly to a file for demonstration).

3.  **Observability Backend:**
    *   **Jaeger:** Deployed within the EKS cluster to receive and store trace data from the OpenTelemetry Collector. It provides a UI for visualizing traces and understanding request flows.
    *   **Prometheus:** Deployed within the EKS cluster to scrape and store metrics data from the OpenTelemetry Collector and potentially from Kubernetes itself (e.g., cAdvisor metrics). Prometheus will be configured to discover targets within the cluster.
    *   **Grafana:** Deployed within the EKS cluster as a visualization layer. Grafana will be configured to use Prometheus as a data source for metrics and Jaeger as a data source for traces, allowing for comprehensive dashboards and drill-downs.

4.  **AWS EKS Infrastructure:**
    *   An EKS cluster will be provisioned in a free tier-friendly configuration, considering the $100 credit limit. This will involve careful selection of EC2 instance types for worker nodes and minimizing the number of nodes.
    *   Necessary IAM roles and policies will be created for EKS, worker nodes, and other AWS services.
    *   VPC, subnets, and security groups will be configured to ensure proper network connectivity and security within the EKS cluster.

### Example Project: OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop

The OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop is a microservice-based distributed system developed by the OpenTelemetry community to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in a near real-world environment. It consists of multiple services written in different programming languages, making it an excellent candidate for demonstrating cross-language tracing and metrics collection.

Its features include:
*   Multiple microservices (e.g., `frontend`, `productcatalogservice`, `cartservice`, `checkoutservice`, `paymentservice`, `shippingservice`, `emailservice`, `currencyservice`, `recommendationservice`, `adservice`)
*   Services written in various languages (e.g., Python, Go, Java, Node.js, C#)
*   Pre-instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDKs, simplifying the setup for demonstration purposes.

This project will serve as the application layer for generating telemetry data, which will then be collected by the OpenTelemetry Collector and sent to Jaeger, Prometheus, and Grafana.
